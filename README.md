## A knapsack test

## Dev

```sh
npm i

npm run ks:start

# You will have to log in to knapsack to see the UI
# See knapsack/dist/tokens for the tokens that are generated
```

## Outstanding issues

- Knapsack is not generating usable CSS for light/dark, this has to be manually derived from the `design-tokens.css` vars
  - This is a knapsack upsale, i think we have to pay more to get it
